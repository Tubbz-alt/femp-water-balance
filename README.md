Ruby on Rails implementation of the Water Balance Tool 
=======

The Federal Energy Management Program developed this Water Balance Tool to provide a method for estimating potable water consumption across multiple water end-use categories at a campus. A water balance compares the total water supply to the volume of water consumed by water-using equipment and applications. The output of the tool provides the estimated potable water consumption by major end-uses and compares the sum of the end-uses to the total potable water supplied to the campus. The final water balance provided by the tool will help users identify the highest consuming end-uses, which will help prioritize water-saving opportunities.

This tool focuses on potable water consumption for major water-consuming equipment at the campus level. The following end-uses are covered in the tool:
Plumbing fixtures (restroom, locker rooms and/or kitchenettes)
Commercial kitchen
Cooling towers
Steam boilers
Laundry (washing machines)
Vehicle wash
Landscape irrigation
Other processes

The water balance results will be provided in the last tab of the tool. The results will include:
A table with the estimated water use by end-use
A bar chart showing the total volume of water used annually by end-use
A pie chart showing the percent breakout by end-use

This tab also will provide information that will help the user understand the water balance results.
